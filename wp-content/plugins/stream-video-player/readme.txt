= Special note =

If the player doesn't show, [download the SWF files](http://www.sendspace.com/file/qzwn8m) and put them on the plugin directory.

Because many many users ask for more capabilities I decided to use (instead of the original swf video player I made) a custom build of the JW Player which uses license CC-NC-SA 3.0 which is a non-GPL compatible license and because that It can't be included on the WordPress directory. The first workaround to fix this was to host the SWF files in other site, but this leads to cross-domain issues and an excessive bandwidth use of my hosting account, so I decided to make the plug-in download the download the SWF files for you on the first run, if you run into troubles check your plug-in directory permissions.

Also notice that the version of JW Player (5.7.1896) used in this plug-in is licensed as Creative Commons: Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported (CC BY-NC-SA 3.0) http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/ - You can use their player freely for personal or non-commercial use. Put it on your personal blog, non-profit, or government website and let the video role. But if you advertise on your site or it's owned by a business, then you have to purchase a commercial license.

== Changelog ==  

= 1.4.1 =
* Small media library working
* Quick tag buttons working
* I want to rewrite this plug-in from scratch, I first published this plug-in on June 13, 2009 based in two or tree other plug-ins, at that time things were completely different, YouTube use to have time limitations, there was no HTML5, Flash use to be the king of the interactive web content, now, reviewing the code I think I can do it better using less code, I want to get rid of Flash and use native HTML5 tags, I want to use some regex to parse the tags, I want to do many things, but wanting to do something is one thing, having the incentive is other, It saddens me to invest so much time on this project and realize how little support from the community I had reflected on donations over the past 5 years and a half, and, in the other hand, realizing that the plug-in is serving at last 17.5 million videos per month, that’s crazy, just imagine that I could get $0.0001 per view per month, that could be $1,750. For that reason I believe this will be the latest time I fix any bug, I think I’ll make a new Stream Video Player but not for free, I really love the free software movement, but sometimes it doesn’t pay enough (or at all) to keep you wanting to support a project… P.D. Merry Christmas.
